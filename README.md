# 👨‍💻 Aykan Aydeniz – Senior Full-Stack Developer | PHP • Symfony • Pimcore • React

> "No limits – as long as the vision is clear."

I don’t believe in “can’t be done” – only in “we’ll figure it out.”  
With the right mindset and a clear goal, even the most complex requirements become robust, scalable solutions.

## 💡 What I Do

I design and build modern, tailor-made web, PIM, and CMS systems – always focused on delivering real business value. I work across the entire lifecycle, from requirements engineering to deployment and long-term maintenance.

Main technologies I use:

- **PHP / Symfony / Pimcore** – for solid, future-proof backend systems
- **React / TypeScript / Redux** – for responsive and fast user interfaces
- **Docker / CI/CD** – for reliable and reproducible environments

## 🧠 What Sets Me Apart

- **Hands-on problem solver** – focused on execution, not excuses  
- **End-to-end perspective** – architecture, implementation, operations  
- **Industry knowledge** – especially insurance & technical documentation  
- **Pimcore expert** – deep experience in workflows, APIs, automation & backend customization
